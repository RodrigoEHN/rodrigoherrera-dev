          I'm a Fullstack Developer focused on building scalable and
          production-ready web applications using modern JavaScript
          technologies.

        <p>
          My background as an Investigation Specialist has strengthened
          my analytical thinking and ability to work with structured
          data to drive informed decisions.

          I combine technical development with problem-solving and
          structured reasoning to create solutions that are both
          functional and data-driven.
